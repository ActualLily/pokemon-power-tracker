# pokemon-power-tracker
Allows you to track the amount of EVs you've gathered so you don't battle wild Rookidees for no reason.

Latest release can be found [here](https://github.com/ActualLily/pokemon-power-tracker/releases "ppt releases").

## Usage
Pick an item your pokemon is holding (or don't!). Click the respective button for what EV the pokemon you beat gives. (e.G. Rookidee gives +1 Speed EV).
